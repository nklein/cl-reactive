# CL-REACTIVE: Reactive functions in Common Lisp

The `CL-REACTIVE` package provides support for reactive programming in
Common Lisp at the function level.  In reactive programming, changing
the value of a variable causes other variables to be updated and other
functions to be invoked.

The common example of reactive programming is a spreadsheet where
changing the value of one cell causes a variety of other cells to be
recalculated.

Common Lisp already has `Cells` which is reactive programming based on
CLOS slots.  Here, reactive programming is handled at a function and
variable level instead of at the slot level.

This package provides signal variables and signal functions.  Signal
variables hold a single, typed value.  Signal functions calculate
their value from the values of signal variables and/or other signal
functions.  Signal variables and signal functions are collectively
referred to as signals.  In most instances, it is not necessary to
distinguish between signal variables and signal functions.  The only
important distinction between the two are that one can explicitly set
the signal value of a signal variable while one cannot do the same for
a signal function.

Constants and functions can be used in place of signals in most places
that expect a signal.

## Basic Signal Manipulations

The fundamental building blocks for all signal operations are:
querying signal values, defining new signal variables, defining new
signal functions, and delaying eager recalculation of signal
functions.

There is a predicate `SIGNALP` to tell whether something is a signal.

    (signalp obj) => t if signal and nil otherwise

### Querying Signal Values

Given a signal `SIG`, one can query its value with the `SIGNAL-VALUE`
method.

    (signal-value sig) => current value of the signal

Calling `SIGNAL-VALUE` with `SIG` calls the function with no arguments
and returns that value.  Calling `SIGNAL-VALUE` with `SIG` a constant
(or anything other than a function or signal) returns that constant.

If `SIG` is a signal variable, one can set the signal value with
`SETF`:

    (setf (signal-value sig) new-signal-value)

One can also use the convenience macro `WITH-SIGNAL-VALUES` to work
directly with the value:

    (defmacro with-signal-values (&rest decls) &body body)

The `DECLS` here is a list of entries each of the form
`(VARNAME SIGNAL)`.  Each `VARNAME` will be bound to the signal value
of the corresponding `SIGNAL`.  For example, given signals `SIG1` and
`SIG2` where `SIG1` is a signal variable and `SIG2` is any signal, one
might do something like:

    (with-signal-values ((v1 sig1)
                         (v2 sig2)
                         (v3 5))
      (incf v1)
      (+ v1 v2 v3))

The `WITH-SIGNAL-VALUES` macro here uses `SYMBOL-MACROLET` to bind
`V1` to the value of `SIG1`, `V2` to the value of `SIG2`, and `V3` to
the value of `5`.

### Defining Signal Variables

One can define a signal variable with global scope using the macro
`DEFSIGNAL-VARIABLE`:

    (defmacro defsignal-variable (name value
                                  &key (type t) documentation)
       ...)

This macro creates a global signal variable bound to the given `NAME`.
The initial value of the signal variable is `VALUE`.  One can
optionally specify the `TYPE` for this signal's values and a
`DOCUMENTATION` string for this signal.  For example, the following
snippet creates a signal variable for monitoring the current
temperature:

    (defsignal-variable *current-temperature* 0
              :type real
              :documentation "Current temperature in degrees Celsius.")

One can also define signal variables in the local context using the macro
`SIGNAL-LET`:

    (defmacro signal-let ((&rest decls) &body body) ...)

The `SIGNAL-LET` macro acts like `LET` but binds signal variables to
the names.  The `DECLS` in `SIGNAL-LET` can be either a symbol or a
list of the form `(NAME VALUE &KEY (TYPE T) DOCUMENTATION)`.  For
example, the following creates a list of three signal variables.

    (signal-let ((sig-a 0 :type integer :documentation "First Signal")
                 (sig-b nil :documentation "Second Signal")
                 sig-c)
      (list sig-a sig-b sig-c))

### Defining Signal Functions

One can define a signal function (calculated signal) with global scope
using the macro `DEFSIGNAL-FUNCTION`:

    (defmacro defsignal-function (name (&rest depends) &body body)
       ...)

This macro creates a global signal function bound to the given `NAME`.
The signal value is calculated from the `BODY` using the signals listed
in `DEPENDS`.  The `DEPENDS` here is a list of entries each of the
form `(VARNAME SIGNAL)`.  Each `VARNAME` will be bound to the signal
value of the corresponding `SIGNAL` for the `BODY`.  The `BODY` will
be executed each time one of the `DEPENDS` signals is updated.

The `NAME` here can be either a symbol or a list of the form
`(NAME &KEY (TYPE T) DOCUMENTATION)`.  The results generated by `BODY`
must conform to the specified `TYPE`.  The `DOCUMENTATION` here will
be used on the signal function itself as well as the wrapper function
`#'NAME`.  If `DOCUMENTATION` is not specified and the `BODY` begins
with a string, that string will be used as the `DOCUMENTATION`.

For example, the following snippet creates a signal variable for
monitoring the current temperature in Farenheit:

    (defsignal-function (current-temperature-f :type real)
                           ((celsius *current-temperature*))
      "Current temperature in degrees Farenheit."
      (+ (* 9/5 celsius) 32))

One can also define signal functions in the local context using the
macro `SIGNAL-FLET`:

    (defmacro signal-flet ((&rest fdecls) &body body) ...)

Each entry in the `FDECLS` list is of the form
`(NAME (&REST DEPENDS) &BODY SIG-BODY)`.  This macro creates a local
signal function bound to the given `NAME`.  The signal value is
calculated from the `SIG-BODY` using the signals listed in `DEPENDS`.
The `DEPENDS` here is a list of entries each of the form
`(VARNAME SIGNAL)`.  Each `VARNAME` will be bound to the signal value
of the corresponding `SIGNAL` for the `SIG-BODY`.  The `SIG-BODY` will
be executed each time one of the `DEPENDS` signals is updated.

The `NAME` here can be either a symbol or a list of the form `(NAME
&KEY (TYPE T) DOCUMENTATION)`.  The results generated by `BODY` must
conform to the specified `TYPE`.  The `DOCUMENTATION` here will be
used for the signal function.

The `SIGNAL-FLET` macro acts like `FLET` but binds signal functions to
the names.  The signal functions depend on other signals.  For example,
the following creates a list of two signal functions that both depend
on the signal `SIG-X`.

    (signal-flet ((sig-abs-x ((x sig-x)) (abs x))
                  ((sig-sqr-x :type integer) ((x sig-x)) (* x x)))
      (list sig-abs-x sig-sqr-x))

### Deferring Signal Updates

There are times when one will be updating multiple signal variables
which are closely related.  Some signal functions may well depend upon
both of them.  For these instances, it is convenient to delay
recalculating signals until all of the updates are done.  One can use
the `WITH-SIGNAL-UPDATES-DEFERRED` macro around a body of code where
signal functions will not eagerly update until the macro has
completed.  Signal functions which are needed within the
`WITH-SIGNAL-UPDATES-DEFERRED` section will be calculated as needed.

For example, in the following code, the

    (signal-flet ((sig-min ((mx sig-mouse-x) (my sig-mouse-y))
                     (min mx my))
                  (sig-max ((mx sig-mouse-x) (my sig-mouse-y))
                     (max mx my)))
      (with-signal-values ((mx sig-mouse-x)
                           (my sig-mouse-y)
                           (mouse-max sig-max))
        (with-signal-updates-deferred ()
          (setf mx new-x
                my new-y)
          (list (/ mx mouse-max) (/ my mouse-max)))))

Neither `SIG-MAX` nor `SIG-MIN` will be updated when `MX` and `MY` are
assigned.  The `SIG-MAX` signal will be updated when it is used to
create the `LIST`.  The `SIG-MIN` signal will not be updated until the
`WITH-SIGNAL-UPDATES-DEFERRED` section ends.

## Composing Signals

The fundamental signal operations above can be composed in a variety
of ways to make more powerful signal constructs.  This section
describes the functions `CL-REACTIVE` provides for composing signals.

### Counting Signal Updates

The `SIGNAL-COUNT` function creates a signal function that returns the
number of times the signal SIG has been updated.

    (defun signal-count (sig &key documentation) ...)

So, for example, to count the number of updates to `SIG-X` in a given
section of code, one might do:

    (with-signal-values ((count-x (signal-count sig-x)))
      ... whatever code one wants here ...
      count-x)

Note: This count actually reflects the number of times that a signal
function dependent on SIG is updated so if SIG is updated multiple
times within a single WITH-SIGNAL-UPDATES-DEFERRED section, this count
would likely not reflect all of those updates.

### Selecting Between Signals

The `SIGNAL-IF` function takes three arguments: `SIG-COND`, `SIG-TRUE`, and `SIG-FALSE`.  It returns a signal function whose value is that of `SIG-TRUE` if `SIG-COND` is non-`NIL` and the value of `SIG-FALSE` otherwise.

    (defun signal-if (sig-cond sig-true sig-false &key documentation) ...)

It is often convenient to use a constant value in place of either
`SIG-TRUE` or `SIG-FALSE` (or both):

    (signal-if sig-cond :yes :no)

### Triggering Only On Changes

A signal function will be triggered each time one of the signals it
depends upon is changed.  Sometimes, the signal function will
recalculate its value and come up with the same result it did the last
time.  With the `SIGNAL-ON-CHANGE` function, one can create a signal
that triggers its dependents only when the value of its input signal
changes.

    (defun signal-on-change (sig &key (key #'identity)
                                      (test #'equal)
                                      documentation)
       ...)

The returned signal only triggers when `SIG` changes value.  The given
`TEST` is used to tell when two values are the same.  The `KEY`
function is invoked on the previous value and the current value then
the `TEST` function is invoked with the results to determine whether
the two values are equal.

In the following example, the `SIGNAL-MAX-CHANGED` signal will not
trigger its dependents even though the `SIGNAL-MAX` signal will.

    (signal-let ((sig-x 100 :type integer)
                 (sig-y 100 :type integer))
      (signal-flet ((signal-max ((x sig-x) (y sig-y)) (max x y)))
        (let ((signal-max-changed (signal-on-change signal-max)))
          (with-signal-values ((x sig-x))
            (setf x 50)))))

One can poll the `SIGNAL-VALUE` at any time, but other signals which
depend upon this one will not be triggered.

The `TEST` function is passed the `KEY` of the previous value followed
by the `KEY` of the new value of `SIG`.  One can use this to create
specialized signals.  The following example triggers only on positive
zero-crossings:

    (labels ((positive-crossing-p (a b)
                (and (or (minusp a) (zerop a))
                         (plusp b)))
             (not-a-positive-crossing-p (a b)
                (not (positive-crossing-p a b))))
      (signal-on-change sig :test #'not-a-positive-crossing-p))

Note: when the `TEST` returns non-`NIL`, there is no change.  As such,
the test is the negation of when there is the desired change.  Another
way one might create an equivalent signal is this:

    (flet ((plusp-ish (a)
             (if (plusp a) 1 0)))
      (signal-on-change sig :key #'plusp-ish :test #'>=))

Again, the `TEST` is used to tell when successive values are
equivalent.  The `TEST` of `#'>=` is, thus, the opposite of when we
want to trigger the signal: `#'<`.

### Signal as a Function of Other Signals

The `SIGNAL-APPLY` function creates a signal function whose value is
obtained by applying a given function `FN` to the values of a list
`SIGNALS` of signals.

    (defun signal-apply (fn signals &key (type t) documentation) ...)

For example, if one needs a signal that tracks the sum of the signals
`SIG-A`, `SIG-B`, and `SIG-C`, one can do:

    (signal-apply #'+ (list sig-a sig-b sig-c))

One can also take advantage of constant signals here to do fancier
calculations.  This following example creates a signal that returns
the position of the last character `A` in the value of `SIG-STRING`:

    (signal-apply #'position (list #\A sig-string :from-end t))

Of course, one could also have written the previous example like this:

    (signal-apply (lambda (s) (position #\A s :from-end t))
                  (list sig-string))

### Reducing a List of Signals

The `SIGNAL-REDUCE` function creates a signal function of whose value
is that of `CL:REDUCE` when run on a given list of signals.

    (defun signal-reduce (fn signals &key
                                       (from-end nil from-end-p)
                                       (start nil startp)
                                       (end nil endp)
                                       (initial-value nil initial-value-p)
                                       (key nil keyp)
                                       (type t)
                                       documentation) ...)

The `TYPE` parameter gives the type specifier for the resulting
signal.  The `DOCUMENTATION` is used to document the resulting signal
function.  The `FROM-END`, `START`, `END`, `INITIAL-VALUE`, and `KEY`
parameters are passed directly to `CL:REDUCE`.

Note: The `START` and `END` do not make as much sense here as they do
in `CL:REDUCE`.  Here, if one uses `START` and/or `END` to specify a
(proper) sublist of `SIGNALS`, the resulting signal function will
depend on signals that are not used in calculating its value.  This
means that it will be triggered at times when there is no hope that
its value will change.  It makes more sense to trim the `SIGNALS` list
before calling `SIGNAL-REDUCE`.

If one has some number of input signals in the list `SIGNALS` and
wants a signal which is the product of those signals, then one might
do the following:

    (signal-reduce #'* signals :initial-value 1)

## A Word About Mutability

It is perfectly possible to create a signal whose value is a `LIST`:

    (defsignal-variable *properties* (list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3)
                        :type list
                        :documentation "ABC properties.")

The behavior of the system is undefined if the signal value is
destructively modified:

    (nreverse (signal-value *properties*))  ; Bad!

Any number of other signals and functions may be looking at that list
at any point in time.  Additionally, such destructive changes do not
trigger signals which depend on the value to be notified that it
changed.

The `CL-REACTIVE` package makes no attempt to enforce the immutability
of the signal values.  It is incumbent on those using `CL-REACTIVE` to
ensure that they do not mutate any values used as signal values.

The behavior of the system is also undefined if any signal variable is
rebound.  For example:

    (defsignal-variable *x* 0)
    ...
    (setf *x* (signal-let ((new-x 0)) new-x))
